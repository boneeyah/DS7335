# Decision Making With Matrices
# This is a pretty simple assignment.  You will do something you do everyday, but today it will be with matrix manipulations. 
# The problem is: you and your work friends are trying to decide where to go for lunch. You have to pick a restaurant thatâ€™s best for everyone.  Then you should decide if you should split into two groups so everyone is happier.  
# Despite the simplicity of the process you will need to make decisions regarding how to process the data.
# This process was thoroughly investigated in the operation research community.  This approach can prove helpful on any number of decision making problems that are currently not leveraging machine learning.
